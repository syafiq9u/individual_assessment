<!--Explanation About Me-->

	<h2 align="center"><u>ABOUT ME</u></h2>
	<h3 align="justify" align="center"> My full name is Ahmad Syafiq bin Ahmad Barhanudin. I was born on 31st January 1999 in Kota Bharu, Kelantan. I have grown up and been here in Kelantan for almost 22 years. I have four siblings, including me, and I'm the third one. During my free time, I will find some events such as wedding ceremonies, birthday parties, and many more to perform playing the saxophone. This is considered as my part-time job as a freelancer while continuing my study.
	<br>
	<br> 
	At this current time, I'm just able to practise my saxophone at home as the pandemic has brought the restriction for a social event to be held. For information, I started to play the saxophone since I was 13 years old and keep improving my skills in playing musical instrument till this day.  Every time I perform the saxophone for the event, I can get around RM 300-RM 500 for one event. Even the payment is not huge; I'm happy to receive it with those amounts as I just try to fill my free time with playing saxophone.
	<br>
	<br>
	During weekend or semester break, I'll try to find my way to travel anywhere that I could go. For instance, if there is a public holiday, I will invite my friends to travel wherever we can go, such as went for hiking, go swimming in the rapids around Kelantan or Terengganu. More than that, if I have extra savings, I will travel to Southeast Asia countries such as Thailand, Indonesia and more will come up.
