		<p style="background-color: lightgrey;">During the mid-semester break in Diploma, I volunteered to join with UiTM Machang Unit Kebudayaan to experience myself giving charity to the homeless people around the Kuala Lumpur city centre. This mission was collaborating between UiTM Machang and the NGO named DATH Charity. The NGO commonly will run their mission every week to serve the homeless that are needed. In this mission, we were given a bunch of essential supplies such as a blanket, food, a healthcare kit, and many more to distribute to the homeless people who truly needed it. We can give the supplies to around 300 homeless people consisting of children, adults, and elders.
